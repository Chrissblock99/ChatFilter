# ChatFilter
A configurable Minecraft Chatfilter Plugin.

Features:
- Automatic dealiasing of e.g. "1" to "i"
- config file for banned words listing words for each that include the banned word but shouldnt be filtered

WARNING:
I have not been working on this since a long time and it has a few minor problems (like filtering every message that starts with "it ").
The config file doesnt work inteirly and i havent debugged in ages.
